# State of the art
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Variant A</th>
    <th>Variant B</th>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <th>Slide to confirm</th>
    <th>Pop-up alert dialog box</th>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <th>
      4 possible action: Drag, Release, Cancel, Confirm
    </th>
    <th>2 possible action: Cancel, Confirm</th>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <td><img src="app/src/main/res/raw/ss_variant_a_2_crop.gif" alt="Image A" style="width:350px; "></td>
    <td><img src="app/src/main/res/raw/ss_variant_b_2.png" alt="Image B" style="width:250px; "></td>
  </tr>

# Proposal
- ***Postulation***: Users may prefer variant B because it’s more tactile and engaging. It creates a sense of satisfaction, although variant A will be faster and users may already familiar with this.

# Hypothesis
• ***H1:*** With variant B users will perform faster than variant A   
• ***H2:*** Users may be more engaging with variant A over B  
• ***H3:*** Variant B may be more familiar to the user than variant A

# Variables
### Independent variables
• ***Design:*** Variant A and B differ in layout and color.  
• ***Interaction:*** The interaction differs between single touch to sliding the interacting component.  
### Dependent variables 
• Speed.  
• User satisfaction.  

# Project Sample
### Variant A
 <img src="app/src/main/res/raw/ss_variant_a_5_full.gif" style="width:250px;" >   

### Variant B
<table>
<tr>
    <td><img src="app/src/main/res/raw/ss_variant_b_1.png" style="width:250px; "></td>
    <td><img src="app/src/main/res/raw/ss_variant_b_2.png" alt="Image B" style="width:250px; "></td>
</tr>
</table>

# Evaluation
• 2 × 2 design.  
• Android Application for both variant.  
• In total 10 users will perform a in-between/within subject test   
• NSA-TLX as post-hoc test.
